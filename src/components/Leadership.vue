I was responsible for managing monthly pitch dinners, weekly house meetings, cleaning blitz, family dinners, retreats, house maintenance, guest dinners and any events the members of the house wanted to put together. There is a lot of work involved in keeping a big house functional, especially when you are in grad school, but I had a lot of fun doing it and I wouldnâ€™t trade my Co Space experience for anything.",
