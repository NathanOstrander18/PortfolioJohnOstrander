My final project in this course was to design a battery casing for an electric skateboard with minimal material and maximized strength using topology optimization. ",

We learned about the material science, process design and major players behind the processes. We also learned about the various tools like CAD and Scanning technologies that may be used with Additive Manufacturing. My final project for this course looked into creating a custom shoe with a functionally graded lattice structure through scanning, meshing, CAD, pressure mapping, and simulation. Scanners used: CreaForm 3D Scanner, Structure 3D Scanner. CAD Packages Used: Geomagic Design X, Autodesk Meshmixer, Autodesk Netfabb, Ansys Workbench, SolidWorks.",

My final project in this course was to design a smart scale for Heever Technologies in collaboration with students from Stellenbosch University. For this project we conducted stakeholder interviews, consumer interviews, technology research, product dissection, alpha and beta prototyping, CAD, app development, app-product integration, and a variety of manufacturing methods. The final prototype was sent to Heever Technologies for further iterations. ",

The course mainly used the Anthropometric Survey of Army Personnel (ANSUR) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We learned how to make predictions for a large data set (NHANES) using a smaller more specific Data Set (ANSUR). Attached is a paper I wrote calling for the de-design of VR goggles using Design for Human Variability. (Attached Paper)",

The course covers cognitive biases and de-biasing, decision making considerations such as game theory and manipulation, and decision-making tools like technology forecasting and lifecycle assessment. For my final project in this course, I ran a human subjects experiment looking at the effect Immersive and Non-Immersive Virtual Reality can have on engineersâ€™ abilities to make Design for Additive Manufacturing decisions.
