                        In the first year of my Masters in Engineering Design Program at Penn State, we were sent to the Hasso-Plattner-Institute School of Design Thinking in Potsdam Germany. I participated in the schools Global Deign Thinking week in August 2017 and March 2018.

                        Design Challenge: “Redesign the 3-S Experience (service, security, cleanliness) for relevant stakeholders on railway stations in a world which digitization is radically changing user’s needs as well as interactions.”
                        For this challenge we were tasked with redesigning the train station experience in Berlin Germany. Since we already had experience with Global Design thinking week we were placed in a group where we had to design 30 years into the future. This required us to look to current trends in technology and where they may lead. We were pushed to come up with our own dystopian societies 30 years in the future, where robots run the world, or where augmented reality is everywhere, or where humans are no longer required to walk, then design for these extremes. The week was focused on designing realistic solutions for an exaggerated future. Same as the prior week, we conducted user interviews, engaged in storytelling, divergent-convergent thinking, timed exercises, role playing, prototyping, user testing, and lots and LOTS of sticky notes.

                        Design Challenge: “Redesign skilled craft trade businesses and its associations in an era of digital transformation: Electricians.”
                        For my first design thinking week, my team and I were challenged with the digitizing the Electrician craft sector in Germany. We tackled this challenge using the HPI Design Thinking Approach: Understand, Observe, Define Point of View, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. In the understand and observe stage we interviewed both electricians and customers (in person and over the phone) to gain insight to how the profession currently operates and communicates and how it might be improved. We then used the ‘Define Point of View’ stage to break down our interviews into consumer and electrician personalities. We then used these personalities in role play to Ideate and Prototype solutions for improved digitization in the craft, here we used divergent convergent thinking. We then tested these prototypes with electricians and iterated based on their feedback.
